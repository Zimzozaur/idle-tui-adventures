## Preliminary Readme
Using this project to learn more about database related topics, testing and more features of textual.
Still WIP, nonetheless if you found your way here and want to play around, you are free to do so.

Using the script under `tools` will create a test character and a test item.
You can also create characters in the application already though. Spawn Items in the inventory screen by pressing keys 0-9.
You can then drag and drop them around.

Progress will be saved in a local sqlite db (current default location is your CWD)
will later be changed to XDG data dir.

Have Fun and feel free to share feedback
